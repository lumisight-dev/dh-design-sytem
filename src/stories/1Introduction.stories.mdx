# Introduction to the Datahouse React Design System

<hr />

The Datahouse React Design System was created to help us build products for our customers more efficiently. Established to be the single source of truth for product teams working on Datahouse React products across the globe, the Datahouse React Design System contains everything from Getting Started guides through to Core Components intended for adoption within each product. It enables product teams to design and develop with speed, consistency, and quality. Our dedicated Design Operations team works with the individual product teams across Datahouse Design System to ensure the system continues to evolve to meet the needs of our designers, developers, and customers.
